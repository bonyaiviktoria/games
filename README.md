# games
I'm learning to code some fun games to expand my experiences with python such as:
- Madlibs
- Guess the Number (computer)
- Guess the Number (user)
- Rock Paper Scissors
- Hangman


## Source
I've seen freeCodeCamp "12 Beginner Python Projects" Coding course, and I used it as a strong base.
Also I tried to implement my own thoughts into the games, and upgrade them.
